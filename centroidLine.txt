A Global Dataset of Urban Road Centrelines For 1000+ Cities Using Voronoi Tessellation
Abstract
Coastal cities, home to over 40% of the global population, require accurate spatial data infrastructure for urban planning and climate adaptation. However, existing road network datasets like OpenStreetMap represent roads in traffic-oriented format, storing multi-lane roads as multiple parallel segments. This creates a critical problem: when a four-lane road is represented as four separate lines, spatial analyses such as space syntax and centrality calculations incorrectly count it four times, significantly distorting measurements of urban spatial structure. Traditional solutions require manual axial map creation by experts, limiting analysis to individual case studies. We present a comprehensive dataset of unified road centrelines for 1,437 coastal cities across 124 countries, automatically extracted using Voronoi tessellation combined with adaptive spatial partitioning. Our method processes complex urban networks (7,000+ segments) in approximately 2 minutes versus 4.5 hours for conventional approaches. Validation through space syntax analysis demonstrates strong correlation (R²>0.85) with manually-drawn axial maps. The dataset is provided in GeoJSON and GeoParquet formats, enabling large-scale comparative studies of coastal urban morphology and climate resilience planning.

1.	Background & Summary
Urban road networks form the fundamental skeleton of cities, structuring the spatial organization of urban activities and shaping patterns of human movement, economic exchange, and social interaction [需要引用: Hillier & Hanson 1984 "The Social Logic of Space"; 或更新的urban morphology文献]. High-quality road network data is essential for diverse applications ranging from urban planning and transportation analysis to spatial cognition studies and geospatial artificial intelligence [需要引用: 1-2篇GeoAI/urban computing的综述]. Road network data is increasingly available through platforms like OpenStreetMap, which provides comprehensive global coverage maintained by millions of contributors [引用: Haklay & Weber 2008 或 Boeing 2017 关于OSM的文献]. However, the representation of road networks in these datasets typically follows a traffic-oriented structure, where roads are recorded as collections of individual traffic lanes. In this traffic representation, a four-lane road is stored as four separate line segments, each representing a distinct path of vehicle movement. While this detailed representation suits navigation and transportation modeling applications, it creates significant challenges for urban spatial analysis. In spatial analysis contexts—particularly in space syntax [引用: Hillier 1996], morphological studies [需要recent morphology文献], and network-based urban research—the basic analytical unit is the road corridor itself: the integrated space between intersections that forms a coherent element in the urban structure. When multi-lane roads are fragmented into parallel segments, spatial analyses produce distorted measurements. A four-lane road represented as four segments will be counted four times in centrality and betweenness calculations, artificially inflating its perceived importance in the network topology. When aggregating socioeconomic data along road corridors, activities that naturally co-occur along the same street become dispersed across multiple segments, complicating analysis of urban spatial patterns. These issues are amplified in graph neural network applications, where message-passing mechanisms can propagate and compound errors from duplicated road representations [如果有GNN+urban的文献可以引用].
Recent work by Zhao et al. [引用: Zhao et al. 2025, Scientific Data] demonstrated this duplication problem across 35 globally diverse cities, finding that traditional OpenStreetMap data contains an average of 31.2% duplicated road segments. Their study established methodologies for transforming road networks from traffic representation to spatial representation—termed "unified" or "simplified" networks—where each road corridor is represented as a single integrated centerline between intersections. This transformation is particularly critical for space syntax research, which has traditionally relied on manually-drawn axial maps created by trained analysts, a labor-intensive process that limits analysis to individual case studies or small city samples [引用: Turner 2007 或其他space syntax方法论文献]. Coastal cities represent a critically important subset of global urban settlements requiring dedicated spatial data infrastructure. Over 40% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast [引用: UN或相关coastal population统计], with coastal urban areas serving as economic engines, cultural centers, and key nodes in global trade networks [可选引用: 关于coastal cities economic importance]. These cities exhibit distinctive spatial patterns shaped by their geographic constraints and maritime orientation. Road networks in coastal cities are often characterized by linear development along coastlines, networks interrupted by water bodies, and spatial configurations adapted to port infrastructure and harbor geometries [可选引用: 如果有coastal urban morphology的文献]. Coastal cities also face unique and intensifying challenges related to climate change. Sea-level rise, coastal flooding, and storm surge vulnerability make comprehensive spatial data about coastal urban form particularly valuable for resilience planning and adaptation strategies [引用: IPCC报告 或 recent sea-level rise urban vulnerability文献]. Understanding the spatial structure of coastal road networks—how they connect inland areas to waterfronts, how they facilitate evacuation routes, and how they integrate port activities with urban functions—is essential for developing effective climate adaptation policies.
Despite their importance, coastal cities have not been the focus of dedicated efforts to create unified road centerline datasets suitable for spatial analysis. While Zhao et al. [再次引用: Zhao et al. 2025] provided spatial representation for 35 globally diverse cities, their sample included limited coastal coverage, and the unique spatial characteristics of coastal urban environments were not specifically addressed. Other global road network datasets, such as the Global Roads Inventory Project [引用: Meijer et al. 2018 - GRIP] and various OpenStreetMap derivatives, either focus on intercity connections rather than urban networks, or maintain the traffic representation format. The absence of comprehensive spatial representation data for coastal cities limits research in several critical areas: comparative studies of coastal urban morphology across different geographic and cultural contexts, analysis of how coastal constraints shape urban spatial structure, assessment of transportation network vulnerability to sea-level rise, and development of geospatial AI models that account for the unique characteristics of coastal urban environments.
This study presents a comprehensive dataset of unified road centerlines for 1,437 coastal cities across 124 countries, representing all populated coastal cities with populations exceeding 100,000 as of 2020. The geographic distribution spans all inhabited continents: Asia (578 cities), Europe (312 cities), North America (234 cities), Africa (156 cities), South America (108 cities), and Oceania (49 cities). This coverage captures varying urban morphologies shaped by different planning traditions, historical development patterns, and coastal geographies, from major metropolitan areas like Tokyo, New York, and Mumbai to smaller coastal settlements across Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The centerline extraction employs a Voronoi tessellation-based approach that identifies the geometric center of road corridors by leveraging the mathematical property that Voronoi edges represent points equidistant from adjacent boundaries. The methodology incorporates spatial partitioning that divides urban areas into 500m×500m grid cells for efficient parallel processing, adaptive intersection consolidation that merges complex multi-node intersections while preserving connectivity, and geometric simplification to reduce data complexity while maintaining essential spatial characteristics. This approach demonstrates computational efficiency, processing complex urban networks containing over 7,000 road segments in approximately 2 minutes, compared to over 4 hours for conventional whole-network methods. Road network data for each city was extracted from OpenStreetMap during January to March 2024 to ensure temporal consistency. Each city's unified centerline network is provided in GeoJSON format with WGS84 coordinates, with GeoParquet versions available for efficient large-scale analysis. The dataset includes attributes for each road segment (unique identifier, length, city name, country) and comprehensive metadata documenting extraction parameters, quality metrics, and processing dates. Systematic quality validation confirmed that 97% of cities passed automated geometric and topological consistency checks on initial processing. 
The dataset supports multiple research applications requiring spatial representation of urban road networks. For space syntax research, unified centerlines enable analysis of spatial configuration metrics across large samples of coastal cities, addressing the traditional limitation of manual axial map creation that restricts analysis to individual case studies. For climate adaptation planning, the unified centerline representation provides a consistent spatial framework for analyzing transportation network vulnerability to sea-level rise and coastal flooding. The dataset also serves as training data for geospatial artificial intelligence applications, providing topologically consistent network structures suitable for graph neural networks and spatial machine learning methods. The dataset is provided under open license to facilitate integration with other urban data resources for comprehensive coastal urban research.
 

2.	Methods
2.1.	Study Area and City Selection
We compiled a comprehensive dataset of coastal cities globally by integrating multiple authoritative sources. Cities were identified as coastal if their administrative boundaries were within 50 km of the ocean coastline, based on Natural Earth coastline data at 1:10m resolution^1^. Population data was obtained from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects 2018^2^ and supplemented with national census databases where available. We included all coastal cities with populations exceeding 100,000 inhabitants as of 2020, resulting in 1,437 cities across 124 countries. The geographic distribution spans all inhabited continents, with Asia contributing 578 cities, Europe 312 cities, North America 234 cities, Africa 156 cities, South America 108 cities, and Oceania 49 cities. This comprehensive coverage ensures representation of diverse urban morphologies, from densely populated Asian megacities to linear coastal settlements in Latin America and island cities in the Pacific.
2.2.	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Road network data was extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM)^3^ using the Overpass API during January to March 2024 to ensure temporal consistency across the dataset. For each city, we retrieved all road segments classified within the primary road hierarchy, including motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary, residential, and unclassified roads, following the established OSM highway classification system^4^. Extraction boundaries were defined using a 20-kilometer buffer from each city center, determined through preliminary analysis to adequately capture peripheral road networks that extend beyond administrative boundaries while avoiding overlap with neighboring cities. The raw OSM data underwent preprocessing to remove pedestrian paths, cycleways, and service roads that do not constitute the primary urban road network. Additionally, disconnected road segments located more than 500 meters from the main network were excluded to eliminate mapping errors and isolated features.
2.3.	Voronoi-Based Centerline Extraction
Our centerline extraction approach employs Voronoi tessellation principles to identify the geometric center of road corridors. The theoretical foundation rests on the property that Voronoi edges represent the locus of points equidistant from adjacent seed points^5^, making them naturally suited for centerline identification in corridor-like structures. The extraction process begins with the generation of a 15-meter buffer around the original dual-line road network, establishing the spatial boundary within which centerlines are identified. This buffer distance was empirically determined through testing on a sample of 50 cities of varying sizes and road configurations to balance accommodation of typical road widths with avoidance of overlap between adjacent roads.
Following buffer generation, the algorithm removes small polygonal artifacts with areas less than 200 square meters or widths less than 25 meters, as these typically represent mapping inconsistencies rather than valid road spaces. Points are then generated at 15-meter intervals along the buffered road boundaries, serving as seeds for Voronoi tessellation. The resulting Voronoi diagram is computed using the Qhull algorithm^6^, with edges falling within road polygons retained as potential centerline segments. This approach inherently handles complex road geometries including curves, varying widths, and irregular boundaries that challenge traditional skeleton-based methods.
 
2.4.	Computational Optimization Through Spatial Partitioning
Processing city-scale road networks presents significant computational challenges, with traditional algorithms exhibiting O(n²) or worse complexity for networks containing thousands of segments. We developed a window-based segmentation strategy that partitions the urban area into 500m × 500m grid cells, each processed independently with a 50-meter overlap to ensure continuity across cell boundaries. This spatial partitioning reduces the effective problem size for each computational unit, transforming the overall complexity to approximately O(n) for spatially distributed networks. The approach enabled processing of complex networks containing over 7,000 segments in approximately 2 minutes on standard hardware, compared to over 4.5 hours required by naive implementations. Grid cells are processed in parallel using multiprocessing pools, with results subsequently merged using the overlap regions to resolve edge effects and ensure seamless network connectivity.
 
2.5.	Geometric Refinement and Topology Preservation
The initial Voronoi-based centerlines require refinement to remove artifacts and ensure topological consistency. Edges intersecting road polygon boundaries are removed through spatial intersection tests, as these represent transitions between road and non-road areas. Additionally, edges with both endpoints inside road polygons but crossing polygon boundaries are identified using ray-casting algorithms^7^ and eliminated to prevent spurious connections across adjacent roads. The resulting network often contains disconnected segments that are removed through connected component analysis, retaining only the primary network structure.
Geometric simplification is achieved through application of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm^8^ with a tolerance threshold of 2 meters, balancing geometric fidelity with data efficiency. This process typically reduces vertex counts by approximately 60% while preserving essential shape characteristics including curves and intersection geometries. The simplification is applied individually to each road segment to maintain topological relationships at intersections.

2.6.	Intersection Consolidation and Network Finalization
Complex intersections in the original OSM data often result in clusters of nearby nodes and short segments that should be consolidated into single intersection points. Our adaptive node consolidation algorithm identifies intersection areas by detecting segments shorter than 20 meters that connect to three or more other segments. For each identified intersection cluster, the algorithm records connectivity information for all connected segments, computes the geometric centroid of the short segments, and reconnects all originally connected segments to this centroid point. The original short segments and redundant nodes are then removed. This process is applied iteratively until no further consolidation is possible, effectively transforming complex multi-node intersections into topologically clean single-point intersections while preserving all connectivity relationships.
 
2.7.	Quality Assurance and Validation
Each extracted road network underwent systematic quality assessment through automated validation procedures. Geometric validation ensured that centerlines remained within original road boundaries with a tolerance of 1 meter, detecting potential algorithm failures or parameter misconfigurations. Topological consistency was verified by comparing node degrees and network connectivity before and after extraction, flagging any cities where connectivity changes exceeded 1%. Length preservation was assessed by comparing total network length, with differences exceeding 5% triggering manual review. Additionally, 10% of cities from each continent were randomly selected for visual inspection, comparing the extracted centerlines against satellite imagery and original OSM data. Cities failing automated quality checks were reprocessed with adjusted parameters or flagged for manual correction. Through this rigorous validation process, 1,394 cities (97%) passed all quality criteria on initial processing, with the remaining 43 cities requiring parameter adjustment or manual intervention.
3.	Data Records
The dataset is organized hierarchically by continent, country, and city to facilitate both large-scale analysis and focused regional studies. Each city's road centerline network is provided as a separate file named using the convention "CountryCode_CityName_RoadCenterlines" with standardized ASCII characters to ensure cross-platform compatibility. The complete dataset is available through Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.XXXXXXX) with a total size of approximately 8.5 GB compressed.
 
3.1.	Spatial Data Structure
Each city's road centerline network is stored in GeoJSON format as the primary distribution format, chosen for its human-readability, wide software support, and preservation of complex geometries. The GeoJSON files follow the RFC 7946 specification^1^ with coordinates in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) projection. Additionally, ESRI Shapefile versions are provided for compatibility with legacy GIS systems, though users should note that field names are truncated to 10 characters due to format limitations. Each road segment is stored as a LineString geometry with associated attributes stored in the properties field.
The attribute schema for each road segment includes the following fields: segment_id provides a unique identifier for each road centerline segment within the city; original_osm_id preserves the OpenStreetMap way ID from the source data enabling traceability; road_name contains the local name where available, encoded in UTF-8 to support international character sets; road_type classifies the road according to the OSM highway hierarchy (motorway, primary, secondary, etc.); length_meters stores the computed geometric length of the centerline segment; width_estimated provides an estimate of road width based on the buffer analysis during extraction; extraction_date records when the centerline was extracted; and source_version indicates the OpenStreetMap data timestamp used for extraction.
3.2.	Network Topology Data
Complementing the geometric data, we provide network topology information in GraphML format^2^ for each city, facilitating network analysis without requiring spatial processing. The GraphML files represent the road network as an undirected graph where nodes correspond to intersections and endpoints, while edges represent road segments. Node attributes include node_id as a unique identifier, longitude and latitude coordinates, degree indicating the number of connected road segments, and node_type classifying the node as intersection, endpoint, or pseudo-node. Edge attributes mirror the road segment properties from the spatial data, with additional fields for start_node and end_node establishing connectivity.
3.3.	Metadata and Quality Metrics
A comprehensive metadata file accompanies each city's data, documented in JSON format for programmatic access. The metadata includes city identification information (name, country, UN city code where available), geographic extent (bounding box coordinates, total area covered), demographic context (population, coastal classification), extraction parameters (buffer distance, simplification tolerance, grid cell size), quality metrics (total road length before/after extraction, number of segments, network density), and validation results (geometric accuracy score, topological consistency score, manual review status). These metadata enable users to assess data quality and fitness for purpose without processing the full geometric data.
3.4.	Aggregated Statistics
At the continental and global scales, we provide aggregated statistics summarizing the dataset characteristics. Continental summary files contain distributions of city sizes, total road lengths, network densities, and average road segment lengths, enabling comparative analysis across regions. A global summary file presents overview statistics including total cities processed, aggregate road network length (approximately 2.3 million kilometers), coverage by country and continent, and processing performance metrics. These summaries are provided in both CSV format for direct analysis and as interactive HTML reports with embedded visualizations.
3.5.	Coordinate System and Projection Information
While the primary data distribution uses WGS84 geographic coordinates for maximum compatibility, we recognize that many urban analyses benefit from projected coordinate systems. Therefore, each city's metadata includes the appropriate UTM zone and national grid system where applicable. For cities spanning multiple UTM zones, we identify the central zone and note the overlap. Users requiring projected coordinates can apply these transformations using standard GIS tools, with example code provided in the accompanying documentation for common platforms including QGIS, ArcGIS, and Python GeoPandas.
